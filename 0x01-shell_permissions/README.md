# 0x01 Shell, permissions

In this project, I learn shell permissions. I should bother studying this topic because of security and privacy concerns in software engineering.

## What each scripts do?

* 0-iam-betty: switches the current user to the user `betty`
* 1-who_am_i: prints the effective username of the current user
* 2-groups: prints all the groups the current user is part of
* 3-new_owner: change the owner of the file `hello` to the user `betty`
* 4-empty: create an empty file called `hello`
