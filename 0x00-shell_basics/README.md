## About The Project

### Context

Performing repetitive tasks with the mouse is no longer for a grown up like up. As a software engineer in the making, I must become computer literate.

Welcome to this journey!

### Built With

* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

### Prerequisites

* git ([_or follow click on this link (download page of Git) if your OS is not Debian/Ubuntu_](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

  ```sh
  apt-get install git
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Feujio/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
   ```
## Task 0: Where am I?

### The problem

Print the absolute path name of the current working directory. In order words, I should provide a script to display where I stand in the file system hierarchy tree. This position should include all the steps to find where I stand.

### Concepts

* Script: a file that the system can execute. It is written in a scripting language: bash, python, ...
* Absolute path name: a type of path that begins with / character
* current working directory: where I stand in the file system hierarchy

### pseudocode & Flowchart
