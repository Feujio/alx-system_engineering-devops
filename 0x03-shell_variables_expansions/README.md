# 0x03 Shell init files, Variables and expansion

In this project, I will explore:
* Linux init  files
* Variables definitions in Bash
* Expansion

## What each scripts do?

* 0-alias: creates an alias
* 1-hello_you: prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user
* 2-path: adds `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program
* 3-paths: counts the number of directories in the `PATH`
* 4-global_variables: lists environment variables
