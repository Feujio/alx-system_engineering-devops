# 0x03 Shell init files, Variables and expansion

In this project, I will explore:
* Linux init  files
* Variables definitions in Bash
* Expansion

## What each scripts do?

* 0-alias: creates an alias
* 1-hello_you: prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user
* 2-path: adds `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program
* 3-paths: counts the number of directories in the `PATH`
* 4-global_variables: lists environment variables
* 5-local_variables: lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions
* 6-create_local_variable: creates a new local variable
* 7-create_global_variable: creates a new global variable
* 8-true_knowledge: prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value we stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`, followed by a new line
* 9-divide_and_rule: prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE`, followed by a new line
* 10-love_exponent_breath: displays the result of `BREATH` to the power `LOVE`
* 11-binary_to_decimal: converts a number frm base 2 to base 10.
* 12-combinations: create a script that prints all possible combinations of two letters, except oo.
  * Letters are lower cases, from a to z
  * One combination per line
  * The output should be alpha ordered, starting with aa
  * Do not print oo
  * Your script file should contain maximum 64 characters
* 13-print_float: prints a number with two decimal places, followed by a new line.
* 100-decimal_to_hexadecimal: converts a number from base 10 to base 16.
  - The number in base 10 is stored in the environment variable DECIMAL
  - The script should display the number in base 16, followed by a new line
* 102-odd: prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line
