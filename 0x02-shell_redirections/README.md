# 0x01 Shell, I/O Rediction

In this project, I will explore a powerful feature used by command line programs called _input/output redirection_.


## What each scripts do?

* 0-hello_world: prints "Hello, World", followed by a new line to the standard output
* 1-confused_smiley:  displays aconfused smiley "(Ã”o)'
* 2-hellofile: displays the content of the `/etc/passwd` file
* 3-twofiles: displays the content `etc/passwd` and `/etc/hosts`
* 4-lastlines: displays the last 10 lines of `etc/passwd` to the display
* 5-firstlines: displays the first 10 lines of `/etc/passwd` to the display 
* 6-third_line: displays the third line of the file `iacta`
* 7-file:  creates a file named exactly `\*\\'"Best School"\'\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:)` containing the text `Best School` ending by a new line
* 8-cwd_state: writes into the file `ls_cwd_content` the result of the command `ls -la`. If the file `ls_cwd_content` already exists, it should be overwritten. If the file `ls_cwd_content` does not exist, create it.
* 9-duplicate_last_line: Duplicate the last line of the file `iacta`
* 10-no-_more_js: deletes all the regular files (not the directories) with a `.js` extension that are present in the current directory and all its subdirectories
* 11-directories: counts the number of directories and sub-directories in the current directory.
  1 The current and parent directories should not be taken into account
  2 Hidden directories should be counted
